I'm proud of this website. The main reasons why I built it are:
- To showcase my work
- To provide an index of my projects intended for public use
- To give a description about me and my skills
- To showcase my design skills
- To show off my own code

In this post, I'll describe the tools I used to build it, the inspiration, and the though process behind it.

# Frameworks and Languages

This website was built in TSX, using [React.js 18.2.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react/v/18.2.0 "See React.js version 18.2.0 on NPM").
I use a framework built on top of React called Next.js. Next provides the common requirements needed in applications, such as routing
and data fetching.

## What is Next.js?

First, Next, like [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), provides the basic process of making a React website.
It provides compilation, minification, and bundling right out of the box.

However, Next also provides tooling to help optimize and boost your app. For example, static and server rendered pages allow you
to render a page ahead of time before the client visits it. This is why a page loads in about two milliseconds or so once
you click a link on this website. Another perk is that these types of rendering also support dynamic content, so even pages
like my blog pages are still generated on the server.

Next also provides something called client-side navigation. This makes the page transition happen using JavaScript *in your browser*.
This method allows lightning fast transitions, and is also the reason why the pages don't flash when transitioning between them.

You can test this out by changing the background of one page. When you navigate to a different page, it stays the same!

## Styling and components

To prevent myself from re-inventing the wheel, some components are taken from
[Radix's Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/ "See Radix's Primitives"). I use [Radix's Stitches](https://stitches.dev/ "See stitches")
for most styling.

## Other Languages

I write my blog using MDX. MDX is Markdown combined with JSX, essentially allowing you to use React components in Markdown.
This allows you to have extended, interactive Markdown. Prism is used for syntax highlighting, and extended functionality is provided
by [remark-directive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-directive/v/2.0.1 "See remark directive version 2.0.1 on NPM").

# Website inspiration

Colors and branding were inspired by [New View](https://nvu.io/en/ "See New View's website"). Additional colors were taken from
[GitHub's primer design system](https://primer.style/primitives/colors "See Primer's primitive colors").
Most icons are from [Primer's octicons](https://primer.style/octicons/ "See Primer's Octicons").

Hero buttons were inspired by [Strapi's buttons](https://strapi.io/ "See Strapi's website"). Although, admittedly,
after I made the designs, I've noticed that the designs were alarmingly similar to
[HERE's branding and hero buttons](https://www.here.com/ "See HERE's website").

The layout and content were inspired from both [Jahir Fiquitiva's](https://jahir.dev/ "See Jahir's portfolio") and
[Justin Kruit's](https://justinkruit.com/ "See Justin's portfolio") portfolios.

# Design and Components

I wanted a simple, minimalistic, modern, and accessible website, with fun and unique elements to it.

Some of the elements I've included (so far) are:

## Status

This element (found on the homepage) displays my current activity. It'll tell you if I'm busy, if I'm asleep, or what song
I'm listening to.

{/* ### Actual Component

<Box centerContent blogDisplay>
    <Status />
</Box>

### Music State

<Box centerContent blogDisplay hasFooter>
    <Status
        overrideState="music"
        overrideMusicDetails={{
            title: 'Original Song Name',
            artist: 'Original Band Name',
            url: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ',
        }}
    />
</Box>

**Fun fact:**

I've written a post about the unique way I made the music icon in the Status component.

Also, you can actually click the status when a song is playing to view it on Spotify or YouTube.

**Fun fact:**

The time displayed in this is actually in your local time, presented how your country nationally displays it.
For example, in the U.S., it would say `3:55 PM`, but in the U.K., it would say `15:55`.
